## ðŸ“˜ API

### `listFilesInFolder(bucketName, folderPath)`

Lists all files (not folders) in a specific S3 folder.

* `bucketName` â€” Your S3 bucket name.
* `folderPath` â€” Must end with `/`, e.g., `"reports/2024/"`.
* Returns: `Promise<string[]>` sorted alphabetically.

### `genSignedUrl(bucket, fileKey)`

Generates a signed URL for a specific file in the bucket.

* `bucket` â€” S3 bucket name.
* `fileKey` â€” Full key including folder path.
* Returns: `Promise<string>` â€” A temporary download URL.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

* Uses AWS SDK v3 (`@aws-sdk/client-s3`, `@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner`).
* Pre-signed URL expiration is controlled via `URL_EXPIRES_IN` environment variable (in seconds).
* Folder names must end with a `/` to properly scope the listing.
* Files are filtered to exclude subfolders and folder markers.
